# Thermodynamic models: fundamentals and computational aspects - Course Project

This repository contains the Python source code to complete the course project from DTU for solving phase and chemical equilibrium problems. All exercises are answered as [unit-tests](./test/), and are summarized in the [final report](./report/DTU%20Exercise%20Report%20for%20Thermodynamic%20Models.md).
